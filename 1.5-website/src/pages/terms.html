          <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Introduction</h3>
          <p class="is-size-4">
            The United Nations Office of Information and Communication Technology is an office of the United Nations, an international inter-governmental organization founded by its Member States pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, and having its Headquarters in New York, New York 10017, working in the context of the United Nations Technology Innovation Labs programme (“UNTIL”).
          </p>

          <p class="is-size-4">UNTIL built the 1point5 app as a free to use app (“the App”). The App is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is. This document is used to inform users of the App regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.</p>

          <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Functionality</h3>

          <p class="is-size-4">
            The App will require Bluetooth turned ON. The App does not require an internet connection. The App requires Push Notifications to be turned on, on your phone. UNTIL cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if these requirements are not met.
          </p>

          <p class="is-size-4">
            The App establishes distances between phones by using their Bluetooth RSSI signal. The App will measure other phones within a radius of 1.5 meters as long as those phones have their Bluetooth turned ON. Those other phones need not have the App installed in order for the App to detect their presence.
          </p>

          <p class="is-size-4">
            By extension of this measurement, a person may be able to detect another person entering his/her sphere of 1.5 meters, as most people carry a phone with Bluetooth turned ON with them. Even though this may be used as an approximation, it will not be accurate in 100% of the cases.
          </p>

          <p class="is-size-4">For example:</p>

          <ul class="is-size-4">
            <li>the other person may not be carrying a phone with them;</li>
            <li>the other person may be carrying a phone with them, with Bluetooth turned OFF;</li>
            <li>the App may measure a phone or other Bluetooth device, which is not actually carried by a person (for example : a television).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Copyright</h3>
          <p class="is-size-4">
            You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the App into other languages, or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to UNTIL.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Development Rights</h3>
          <p class="is-size-4">
            UNTIL is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the App at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the App.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Responsibilities and Liabilities</h3>
          <p class="is-size-4">
            The App is provided free of charge and intended as a means of support for “social distancing” between people. It in no way aims to be a substitute for instructions provided by government and health authorities or a user’s own common sense.
          </p>
          <p class="is-size-4">
            If at any time information provided by the App conflicts with information or instructions provided by health authorities, the government or a user’s own common sense, information provided by the App will yield and the former information will prevail. The user of the App is at all times responsible for his/her own health and of those around him/her.
          </p>
          <p class="is-size-4">
            UNTIL accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, a user may experience as a result of relying wholly on the functionality of the App.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Roadmap</h3>
          <p class="is-size-4">
            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. UNTIL does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
          </p>
